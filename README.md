## Website - Bookstore Catalogue

The goal of this project was to create a website for a bookstore catalogue using ASP.NET Core with MVC architecture. 
Back-end was written in C#.
Front-end with JS, HTML, CSS (with bootstrap)
Data base – SQL
Application:
1.	In the home page, you can see the two most popular books in the store – popularity is based on the number of comments for each book.
2.	In the catalogue page, you can filter books by genre, see book title and cover and click on 'details' for more details on that book.
3.	In the details pages, you can see all the info about a book, and also all the comments about it. You can also add your own comment.
4.	In the admin page, you have to login using these credentials:
    UserName = AllPowerfullAdmin
    Password = Qwe!@#123Rt$
5.	After successful login, you can do CRUD operations here – create, read, update or delete a book.
