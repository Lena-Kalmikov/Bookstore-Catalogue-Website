## Bookstore Catalogue Website

The goal of this project was to create a website for a bookstore catalog using ASP.NET Core with MVC architecture. 

- Back-end: C#.
- Front-end: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- Database: MSSQL.

Application:
1.	Home page: See the two most popular books in the store – popularity is based on the number of comments per book.
2.	Catalogue page: Filter books by genre, view book title and cover, and click on 'details' for more info about that book.
3.	Details page: View all info about a book, and all the comments on it. Add a new comment.
4.	Admin page: You have to login using these credentials:
- UserName = AllPowerfullAdmin
- Password = Qwe!@#123Rt$
5.	After successful login, do CRUD operations here – create, read, update, or delete a book.
